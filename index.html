        <h4>MadLibs Website</h5>
        <p>
            Description: As a demonstration of my skills in both front-end and back-end development, I created a Madlibs website using JavaScript on the front-end and employed the following technologies on the back-end: Axios, CORS, and Express.js.
            <br>
            <br>
            Technologies Used: Axios, CORS, Express.js, HTML, CSS
            <br>
            <br>
            GitHub Repository: <a href="https://github.com/yogurlval/FoundationsCapstone" target="_blank">MadLibs Project</a>
            <br>
            <br>
            In this project, I put my skills to the test to create an interactive and engaging Madlibs game. Users are prompted to input various parts of speech, such as nouns, adjectives, and verbs. Upon submission, the inputs are sent to the server using Axios, and the back-end built with Express.js processes the data and generates a hilarious Madlibs story. The website is styled using HTML and CSS to provide an aesthetically pleasing user interface.</p>
